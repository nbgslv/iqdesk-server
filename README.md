# Installing and running Server

## Installing

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. You should create an `.env` file in the file project root folder, with the following variables:

    * `PORT=3001`

## Running demo server

After installing dependencies, run `npm start` to start demo server.

**The server should run on port 3001. Before running the command, please make sure the port is free of
use, otherwise the demo won't work properly.
